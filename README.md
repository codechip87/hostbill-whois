hostbill-whois
==============

This file is the replacement for hostbill's `/include/extend/whois/whois.php`, with patches from [hostbillforums](http://www.hostbillforums.com/index.php/topic,68.0.html), aims to resolve `Supplied TLD is incorrect` and similiar issue.

I will continuously add new domain and fix known issues in this file. Patches and PRs welcome!
